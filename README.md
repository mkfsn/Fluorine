Fluorine is a library, provide a way to let programmer isolate side-effect computations in their progams.
It also provides a very basic notifying mechanism, to help programmers develop programs based on application layer notifications.

## Why Bothers ?

Javascript has first-class function feature, which let programmers can easily develop some funtional-flavor programs.
And libraries like underscore.js did the great job to enrich the toolbox of functional developing.

But as a language, Javascript still lacks other important features in real functional languages like Haskell,
and it also lacks process controlling features which may ease the headache from asynchonous execution.

This library want to resolve these problems without developing new DSL language ( which enforce user must have a compiler in their application ).
It represents a DESL, which deeply inspired by the famous jQuery library, and borrows many ideas about context-based computation from Haskell.
Thus developers can still write only Javascript, and use more functional features.
