# <a id="fluorine"></a>Fluorine

[Fluorine](https://github.com/snowmantw/Fluorine) is a Javascript library and eDSL, want to help developers constructing their 
application with more functional features, and build large programs from small functions.
It currently has these features:

* [Isolate impure parts in the program.](#isolate-impure-parts-in-javascript-applications)
* [Allow to mix pure/impure when necessary.](#break-the-glass-in-emergency)
* [Flow-Control](#flow-control), to avoid callback hell.
* [Laziness](#laziness) (well, sort of) .

It's first inspired by the [Arrowlets](http://www.cs.umd.edu/projects/PL/arrowlets/api-arrowlets.xhtml) library, 
which brought the functional structure, Arrowlet, into Javascript world. Of course, the great [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) 
and [Underscore.js](http://underscorejs.org/) also shown how amazing Javascript could be.

Futhurmore, this library also want to experiment the possibility of constructing reasonable Javascript programs 
**without (too much) class, object and other OOP things**. Because Javascript, at least according to Douglas Crockford, 
["has more in common with functional languages like Lisp or Scheme than with C or Java".](http://www.crockford.com/javascript/javascript.html)
This is a good point in this OOP-overflowed age, especailly most of libraries are all eager to provide class, inheritance and other OOP stuffs.


## <a id="main-concepts"></a>Main Concepts

Fluorine use a structure named **context** to wrap those computations with side-effects. 
The name "context" means it's different from other purer and stronger structures like 
[Arrowlet](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Typeclassopedia#Arrow), 
[Monad](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Typeclassopedia#Monad) and 
[MonadTransformer](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Typeclassopedia#Monad_transformers). 
These structures are delicate enough but also hard to implement well in this little eDSL (at least, in current stage) .

Contexts in Fluorine are just predefined functions like the "jQuery" function, and the main difference is 
that the later don't provide mechanisms to execute lazily, so we can't directly combine all jQuery chains togeter to build a large program. 

Other differences between jQuery and Fluorine's contexts are that jQuery didn't care about side-effects, 
and it's combinators mainly provide UI manipulations. These differences don't mean it isn't a great Javascript library, 
but only show there're some holes need to be filled. So Fluorine actually depends on `jQuery` and `underscore.js`, 
which can easily build important UI and other computations. This library just provide some contexts to orgranize them in proper ways.
 

## <a id="features"></a>Features

### <a id="isolate-impure-parts-in-javascript-applications"></a>Isolate Impure Parts in Javascript Applications

Fluorine's contexts can help Javascript programmers isolate impure parts in their applications, 
so that errors resulted from side-effects can be reduced as much as possible:

    // Infect whole context to omit prefix namespaces.
    // You can restore this by call `fluorine.heal()`.
    fluorine.infect()
    
    // Impure function: directly manipulate DOMs in the document.
    // All impure computing should be wrapped with contexts.
    //
    // :: String -> UI ()
    drawMyName = function(name)
    {
        // $() means apply jquery: `a -> UI $DOM`    
        return UI('#name-user').$().text(name).done()
    }
    
    // Pure function: return a plain old string.
    //
    // :: String 
    giveName = function()
    {
        return "foobar"
    }

Programmers still can mix them in some proper ways, like in a generator function 
returing yet another larger context:


    // Generator means this function will return another context wrapped value, rather than a pure value.
    //
    // :: UI ()
    drawApp = function()
    {
        return UI().
            let(giveName).as('name').   // Allow to define some local variables in the scope of chain.
            tie( function()             // Allow tie with other chains to build large chain.
            {
                // Use local variables just like "let" in other languages.
                var slc_ex1 = '#ex1'

                // Subchain's result will become next step's input.
                // In this case, it will return `UI $DOM`
                return UI("<div id='name-user'></div>").$().appendTo(slc_ex1).done()
            }).
            tie( function($dom)
            {   
                // Fetch the value pre-defined by `let` and `as`.
                return drawMyName(this.name)
            }).
            done()  // Don't forget to close this chain.
    }


### <a id="break-the-glass-in-emergency"></a>Break the Glass in Emergency

Basically, pure functions and values can't arbitrarily mix with impure values:

    // :: String
    pureString = function()
    {
        return "pure"
    }

    // :: UI String
    impureString = function()
    {
        return UI("impure").done() 
    }

    illegal_string = pureString() + impureString()  // Error. 

But in some special cases, we still can do that if the context come with some extractor functions:

    illegal_string = pureString() + impureString()().extract()  // extract:: UI String -> String

Also, we can do some dirty works in the theoretically pure combinator, like the `let` or `_`:

    UI('#name-user').$().
        _(function(e)           // Call it "lambda" if you like.
        {
            // Should keep pure, not violenting like this:
            $(e).text("name changed !")
        }).
        done()

This is useful because sometimes we may want to embed 3rd libraries in our contexts.

Nevertheless, these tricks should be exceptions, not normalities.


### <a id="flow-control"></a>Flow-Control

Fluorine use a hidden and stack based process to manage each step in context chains. The most classical example is the `IO` context:

    IO().
        get('/ajax/hello').as('hello').         // Delegate to `jQuery.get` .
        get('/ajax/world').as('world').
        _(function(){ return this.hello + ' ' + this.world }).
        tie(function(msg)
        {
            return UI('<div id="io-msg"></div>').$().text(msg).appendTo('body').done()
        })
        done()

Here, we get a serialized execution of multiple Ajax requests. The second `get` will not execute unless the first one got successfully executed.
In this way, we can "flatten" nested Ajax callbacks such like:

    function requests()
    {
        var responses = {}
        $.get('/one', function(one)
        {
            responses["one"] = one
            $.get('/two', function(two){
                responses["two"] = two
                $.get('/three', function(three){
                    responses["three"] = three
                    $('#io-msg').text(responses["one"]+responses["two"]+responses["three"])
                })
            })
        })
    }

Into this:

    function requests()
    {
        return IO().
            get('/one').as('one').
            get('/two').as('two').
            get('/three').as('three').
            tie(function()
            {
                return UI('#io-msg').$().text(this["one"]+this["two"]+this["three"]).done()
            }).
            done()
    }

Of course there're many flow-control libraries promising this, but Fluorine hope this feature can naturally become a part of context-based computing,
not a standalone feature.

Concurrent IOs like initialize multiple requests in the same time is not implemented yet. It will be a important feature in the near future.


### <a id="laziness"></a>Laziness ( well, sort of ) 

Context chains in Fluorine will not execute immediately, unless it's required.

    // Normal jQuery chain will execute immediately:
    act = $('#io-msg').hide().css('background-color', 'cyan').text('New message').fadeIn()

    // Fluorine chain: nothing happened.
    act = UI('#io-msg').$().hide().css('background-color', 'cyan').text("New message").fadeIn().done()

So we can storage the chain to embed and apply it in anywhere we want

    // Can return entire chain because it will not execute in this function. 
    // :: UI ()
    function newMessage()
    { 
        return UI('#io-msg').$().hide().css('background-color', 'cyan').text("New message").fadeIn().done()
    }

    // When the program initialize, execute it:
    newMessage()()

The first application of `newMessage` function is for generating the `UI ()` value:

    // :: UI ()
    newMessage()

And the next is for extract (execute) pure value from it:


    // :: UI () -> ()
    newMessage()()

Because the `UI () -> ()` will return nothing, `newMessage()()` will return nothing.

The second `()` is like runner functions in Haskell. 
For instance, the `runST:: (forall s. ST s a) -> a` can "execute" a ST Monad.

If the anonymous functions annoy you, we also provide `id` function. 
Using it to directly put a chain in another chain can avoid the annoying anonymous function syntax:

    // Notice the anonymous generator function get disappeared.

    Event('initialize').
        tie(id( UI('#io-msg').$().hide().css('background-color', 'cyan').text("New message").fadeIn().done() )).
        done()

The "lazyness" and the way we controlling processes are exactly why users should never expect to extract values from IOs: 
we can't guarrantee the IO chain will execute and return the value as users wish. In fact, if someone do this:

    // Try to extract the result of IO context:

    var hello = IO().
        get('/ajax/hello').
        done()().extract()

    // And directly use it in another one:
    
    UI('#io-msg').$().text(hello).done()()

The `hello` shall be null because the asynchronous `get` still waiting the response. 
If values from IO is needed by other contexts, embedding them in the chain is the standard way to satisfy the request:

    IO().
        get('/ajax/hello').
        tie( function( msg )
        {
            // Instead of try to get the IO handled value outside, 
            // it's better to embed the receiver context in.

            return UI('#io-msg').$().text(msg).done()
        }).
        done()()

## <a id="how-to-use-it"></a>How to Use It


### <a id="initialize"></a>Initialize

Normally, use `fluorine.infect()` first, to omit prefix namespace and do some initialization works:

    fluorine.infect()

This will embedded Fluorine utils functions and contexts in `window` object, so you call directly use them:

    fluorine.infect()
    IO().
        get('/ajax/hello').
        tie(function(hello)
        {
            return UI('#io-msg').text(hello).done()
        }).
        done()()


You can use `fluorine.heal()` to remove the infection.

### <a id="guides-N-common-mistakes"></a>Guides and Common Mistakes

#### <a id="wrap-all-computation-with-side-effects"></a>0. Wrap all computation with side-effects

Contexts can wrap a pure value to lift it:

    a = "#msg"           // String
    UI(a).done()         // UI String

Only wrapped or locally defined values can join computations in the chain:

    UI(a).$().          // Use the wrapped ID to select element: `a -> UI $DOM`
        hide().
        tie(function($dom)
        {
            // Like "let" in other languages
            var msg = "Some Message"

            // This subchain will return `UI $DOM` to next step.
            return UI($dom).$().text(msg).done()
        }).
        fadeIn().
        done() 

However this is Javascript, Fluorine will keep slient if you still decide to do that dirty works.

#### <a id="every-context-chain-should-be-enclosed"></a>1. Every context chain should be enclosed

This is resulted from the limitation of our eDSL, which need to do some post-action after user defined a new chain, 
but it's impossible to know that without the step because we don't have a compiler.

So, if you `tie` an undone chain in another context, it's an error:

    fluorine.infect()
    IO().
        get('/ajax/hello').
        tie(function(hello)
        {
            return UI('#io-msg').$().text(hello)        // Undone context
        }).
        done()()
    
When this IO chain got executed, it will throw:

    "Tying an undone context or just not a context."

#### <a id="dont-forget-the-period"></a>2. Don't forget the period

Just like jQuery and underscore.js, you will get strange results and errors if you forget the peroid:

    
    fluorine.infect()
    IO().
        get('/ajax/hello')                              // Missing the peroid
        tie(function(hello)
        {
            return UI('#io-msg').$().text(hello)        // Undone context
        }).
        done()()

When this IO chain got executed, it will throw an error:

    "ReferenceError: tie is not defined

Because "ReferenceError" is a general error, you will find it's hard to debug.
So before you typing anything, it is a good practice to insert a period after the chain.

Of course, you can choose period-prefix style to make the problem more significant:

    
    fluorine.infect()
    IO()
        get('/ajax/hello')                              // Missing the peroid; more apt to discover it 
        .tie(function(hello)
        {
            return UI('#io-msg').$().text(hello)        // Undone context
        })
        .done()()

But some DSL like Coco and CoffeeScript may not accept such style, and will give compiling errors while you want to mix this eDSL and the DSL.


#### <a id="turn-on-the-debug-option"></a>3. Turn on the debug option

Fluorine can output every steps it executed, to help you debug the program:

    fluorine.infect()
    fluorine.debug(true)                                // Turn the debug mode on
    IO().
        get('/ajax/hello'). 
        tie(function(hello)
        {
            return UI('#io-msg').$().text(hello)        // Undone context
        }).
        done()()
    fluorine.debug(false)                               // Turn off the debug mode

When you turn on the mode, Fluorine will print out every steps and errors in your console:

    [DEBUG] Process executing step #0, step name(if any): Context::initialize ( call with ), [] fluorine.js:100
    [DEBUG] Process executing step #1, step name(if any): Context::tie, next level -->  ( call with ), [undefined] fluorine.js:100
    [ERROR] Process terminated at step #1, step name(if any): Context::tie, next level -->  Tying an undone context or just not a context. fluorine.js:100
    [ERROR] Process terminated at step #1, step name(if any): Context::initialize Tying an undone context or just not a context. fluorine.js:100

Here you can see the undone context stop the execution, just in the `tie` function.

This debugging mode is still in very early stage, so it's messages sometimes look like hard to understand.
Making it better if you can do some contributes !


#### <a id="execute-chains-only-when-its-necessary"></a>4. Execute chains only when it's necessary

Fluorine encourage programmers to create small funcions named generators, which return context chains rather than normal values:

    // :: UI ()
    function createMsgBox()
    {
        return UI('body').$().append('<div id="#io-msg"></div>').done()
    }

    // :: String -> UI ()
    function drawMsg(msg)
    {
        return UI('#io-msg').$().text(msg).done()
    }

    // :: IO ()
    function main()
    {
        return IO().
            tie( createMsgBox ).
            get('/ajax/hello').
            tie( drawMsg ).
            done()
    }

    // Not execute any chains, until the last moment:
    main()()  

These functions, except the last one, will not be executed in entire program. They just provide some subchains to the main context.

In fact because these "chains" are just context wrapped values, they're unsurprisedly can be stored and passed to another function as arguments.
This feature also means it's possible to create Javascript programs with a "compile time" phase, which can find errors before we run it.

You may also notice that the two subchains are defined in some named functions, not in anonymous functionsan error in the IO chain.
It's more clear and important while users want to mix 3 or more contexts in one main chain. 
Anonymous generators are easy to write but also has over-nested problem, unless we can change the syntax with other DSLs like CoffeeScript or Coco.

## <a id="use-with-other-dsls"></a>Use with Other DSLs

Although Fluorine want to provide functional features **without** any compiler, it can perform more sweet syntax 
if you can use it with other DSLs like CoffeeScript or CoCo :

    // :: UI ()
    createMsgBox = !-> UI('body').$().append('<div id="#io-msg"></div>').done()

    // :: String -> UI ()
    drawMsg = !-> return UI('#io-msg').$().text(msg).done()

    // :: IO ()
    main = !-> IO().
            tie( createMsgBox ).
            get('/ajax/hello').
            tie( drawMsg ).
            done()

    // Not execute any chains, until the last moment:
    main()()


The original version with plain Javascript:

    // :: UI ()
    function createMsgBox()
    {
        return UI('body').$().append('<div id="#io-msg"></div>').done()
    }

    // :: String -> UI ()
    function drawMsg(msg)
    {
        return UI('#io-msg').$().text(msg).done()
    }

    // :: IO ()
    function main()
    {
        return IO().
            tie( createMsgBox ).
            get('/ajax/hello').
            tie( drawMsg ).
            done()
    }

    // Not execute any chains, until the last moment:
    main()()  
    
And we can get even close to real curry functions ( not directly related to Fluorine, but it's a very important advantage ):

    add3 = a -> b -> c-> a+b+c

If we implement that with plain Javascript, it will become a nightmare:

    add3 = function(a)
    {
        return function(b){
            return function(c){
                return a+b+c        // Nested, WTF
            }
        }
    }
